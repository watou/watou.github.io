I wrote a plugin for the [Vera][] home automation system that allows you to monitor and control your [Nest][] Learning Thermostats and Protect Smoke and CO detectors.  The project's documentation can be found [here](/vera-nest/).  If you have a Vera home controller, you can install the plugin directly from your Vera.  I hope you like it!
