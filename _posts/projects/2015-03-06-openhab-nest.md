I wrote a binding for the [openHAB][] home automation bus that lets you monitor and control your [Nest][] thermostats and smoke+CO detectors.  The binding's wiki can be found [here](https://www.openhab.org/addons/bindings/ecobee1/).  If you install the openHAB software on a suitable system, you can install the binding by copying a JAR file into the `addons` directory and editing the `openhab.cfg` file.  I hope you like it.
