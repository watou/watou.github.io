I have successfully developed a growing list of websites for commercial customers in several different business sectors.  I have, to my knowledge, a 100% satisfaction rating among my clients.

I am versed in almost all of the popular (and some obscure) web languages and technologies.  I am able to gather requirements and objectives efficiently, and then go off and build what the client has imagined, or sometimes even better than that.

Please contact me if you feel that I may be of service.
